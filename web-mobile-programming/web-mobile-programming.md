_The correct answers are highlighted in bold_

1. What are HTTP Verbs?
	- HTTP verbs standardise a way of informing the client about the result of its request.
	- **HTTP verbs tell the server what to do with the data identified by the URL.**

	- HTTP verbs are how you identify the things that you want to operate on.
2. What is the role of the server in HTTP?
	- **The server houses necessary resources, such as files, databases, devices, and even processing power.**
	- The server runs applications that the user interfaces directly with.
	- The server provides a route to access network
3. What is an example use case of cURL?
	- cURL can be used for dependency management on UNIX machines
	- cURL can be used to optimise web application speed
	- **cURL can be used to make remote HTTP requests**
	- cURL can be used to create terminal applications on UNIX
4. Which of the following is a safe HTTP method?
	- **GET**
	- POST
	- PUT
	- DELETE
5. When designing RESTful APIs, which of the following is a possible scenario where the POST method should be used?
	- Deleting a resource
	- Update a resource
	- **Creating a resource**
	- Accessing a single resource
6. What is the meaning of 401 Unauthorised HTTP response code?
	- Bad Request
	- Resource does not exist
	- **Login is required**
	- Malformed request
7. Which of the following best explains the Request-Response cycle?
	- Separation of concerns in application development.
	- **Continuous exchange of information between server and client in a call-answer manner.**
	- Web service design pattern that encourages using a Modular Service based architecture.
8. What is the advantage of Token based authentication over Server Side authentication?
	- Token based authentication is fast because it is based on C
	- **Token based authentication can be used for authentication in RESTful APIs.**
	- Token based authentication is supported in the US only.
	- Token based authentication does automatic token generation on the fly.
9. Which of the following accurately explains the meaning of 'statelessness' is RESTful API Design
	- Information sent during a request is automatically persisted over multiple requests
	- **Each request is a transaction processed independent of previous requests.**
	- Request is processed regardless of the HTTP Verb being used
	- Session management is done via Local Storage
11. The JWT signature is a combination of which of the following
